      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <strong>Abstract</strong><br>

      This document collects together into one definition all the specs that together
      form the current state of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) as of 2020.
      The primary audience is CSS implementers, not CSS authors,
      as this definition includes modules
      by specification stability, not Web browser adoption rate.
      CSS is a language for describing the rendering of structured documents
      (such as HTML and XML) on screen, on paper, etc.
